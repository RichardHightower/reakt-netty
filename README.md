# Reakt Netty

The idea behind this is to create the thinnest possible wrapper around Netty so that Reakt projects that
need IO can use Reakt-Netty.

This does not in anyway shape or form try to abstract the low level details of Netty. 
If that is what you are looking for, then look into Vert.x.

This is just a thin wrapper of Netty to adapt Reakt streams and promises.
